-press merge request, once the next page is loaded fill out all relevant data for your merge request(description, assigning the merge to someone, assigning a reviewer, etc.)
-Then press create merge request. 

**NOTICE**: Make sure that you indeed want to delete your branch upon the merge request being accepted

-Whoever has the authority to accept the merge request will now have to navigate to the relevant merge request via Merge Request on the left hand side of the screen
-Once on the next page the proper authority will approve the merge request by selecting the approve button below the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons
-If there are any conflicts that need to be resolved accordingly
-When there are no conflicts to be resolved at the bottom of the screen there should be a button to merge the two branches
