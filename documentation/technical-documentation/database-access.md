# How to access Database information through the front end

# ADDITIONAL
- Database is now on Render.com
- Give it some time to answer the first GET request and then is tends to speed up.
- The following routes have been tested and work with Postman.
  - https://phill-in-the-blank.onrender.com/api/test
  - https://phill-in-the-blank.onrender.com/api/products
  - https://phill-in-the-blank.onrender.com/api/reviews
  - https://phill-in-the-blank.onrender.com/api/questions
